## About the Project
This project is designed as an immersive learning experience in the realm of web3 development using Substrate. It serves as a practical exploration and application of the principles and technologies within the Substrate ecosystem. Our primary objective is to grasp the intricacies of web3 development and harness the power of Substrate to build decentralized solutions that can shape the future of blockchain technology.

Through hands-on development and collaboration, we aim to acquire a deep understanding of Substrate's capabilities, from building blockchains to simulating networks, adding trusted nodes, and implementing smart contracts. By the end of this project, we aspire to not only have honed our technical skills but also to have contributed to the broader knowledge pool of Substrate development within the Patika.dev Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp community.
